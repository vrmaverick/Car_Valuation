# Car_Valuation
This is Semester 6 ML case-study 

The goal was simple: Implement and compare multiple regression models to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for this kind of problem.

ğŸ“ˆ Model Performance Comparison:

ğŸ”¸ Random Forest
â€ƒMSE: 10.0604 | MAE: 1.9459 | RÂ²: 0.9502

ğŸ”¸ Ridge Regression
â€ƒMSE: 0.3060 | MAE: 0.3876 | RÂ²: 0.9985 âœ…

ğŸ”¸ Lasso Regression
â€ƒMSE: 35.7025 | MAE: 4.3625 | RÂ²: 0.8233

ğŸ”¸ Support Vector Regression
â€ƒMSE: 5.4015 | MAE: 0.6531 | RÂ²: 0.9733

ğŸ“Œ Takeaway: Even with a limited dataset, regularized linear models like Ridge Regression can deliver exceptional results when tuned well â€” and sometimes even outperform more complex models like Random Forests and SVRs.

This project was a great way to solidify my understanding of model selection, overfitting, and performance evaluation.
